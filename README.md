The goal of this project is to classify wine into different categories based on a dataset that includes various chemical properties of the wine, such as acidity, alcohol content, and pH levels. By using this model, we can predict the class of wine with high accuracy, assisting in wine quality control or categorization.
The dataset used for this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset].


Features: e.g., acidity, alcohol, pH, residual sugar, etc.
Target Variable: Wine type or quality rating
